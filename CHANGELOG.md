## 0.3.4 - Better automatic ribbon growth
 - Majorly improves the method for automatically trimming and growing the tail end (rightmost columns) of the ribbon.

If you were unlucky enough to download versions 0.3.0 through 0.3.3, you might have to update CodeRibbon outside Atom due to a bug where single-column window sizes would lock the editor. Do so with `apm update`, if that doesn't work, let us know by creating an issue!

## 0.2.5 - Atom v1.57.0 required
 - Removal of some code due to an upstream fix (CR issue #74)

## 0.0.33 - Atom v1.47.0 required
 - Scrolling issue fixed in upstream Atom allowed removal of workaround code.
